This is the testbench for the Router component.

Files included:
    Makefile
    arch9_8x8
    m3x3.topology
    Router_tb.v
    prep_test.sh
    sim.do
    wave.do

The Router component is tested using traces extracted from the simulation
of a 3x3 mesh network in the architecture simulator. The traces capture
the input and output of a single router in the network and we use these
traces to test the functionality of the Router component.

To run the testbench, follow these steps:

1. Use prep_test.sh to generate the trace and configuration byte-stream
   that is used to configure the Router module under test
   
       ./prep_test.sh m3x3.topology arch9_8x8 1

   This command runs the architecture simulator and generates the trace 
   file for Router 1.

2. Launch Modelsim
3. Run 'make' to build the Verilog simulation library
4. Run 'make dpilib' to build the DPI library
5. Run 'do sim.do' to run the simulation

Check the simulation output (stored in 'transcript') for error messages.
